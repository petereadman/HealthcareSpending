## A look at how much Americans spent 'out-of-pocket' on healthcare in 2022 

### OBJECTIVE
Explore out-of-pocket medical expenditure in the US with the aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the out-of-pocket expenditures in the US healthcare system, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to improve affordability and accessibility for all citizens.

### Introduction

The US healthcare system is not really a single system. It's more like a complex web of different systems interacting with each other. Healthcare in the US is expensive, but expensive to whom?

National healthcare expenditure suppased $4 trillion in 2021 and is on course to make up 20% of GDP in coming years. These are staggering numbers and difficult to relate to.

This enquiry will focus on the piece of the financial puzzle Americans feel most directly: **Out-of-Pocket**
